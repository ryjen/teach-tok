An application for displaying multiple-choice questions in a TicTok style interface.

(A take home test).

Made with â™¥ in VIM.

## Notes

- clean architecture as a foundation, separation of application layers
- feature based modules ([forYou](src/feature/forYou))
- data flows in one direction from data layer, to domain, to application, to presentation
- redux actions dispatch data flow through the layers
- dependency injection and immutables but left out for now
- use case hooks

### get next question

**design**:

The app maintains an internal cache of prefetched items.

The prefetching is building the internal cache for swiping.

API calls will prefetch using an exponential backoff algorithm.

**process**:

- use cases makes current request for data
- maps the data to the domain layer and preloads the image
- prefetches the next

### time in app

- keeps a counter in redux store
- sets a timer for every minute
- calculates difference
- dispatch redux action to update UI

## Design Flaws

- backend returns a single random result, not idempotent

## Testing

- left out, not using CI, my code is perfect,
